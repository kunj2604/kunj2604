**💡 Pro Tip:** *If you're reading this far, you're probably as passionate about code as I am about avoiding bugs in production!*

⭐ **Star my repos if they helped you!** (Or if you just want to make me smile 😊)

```diff
+ Currently available for interesting projects and collaborations!
+ Always ready to discuss Python, Flutter, or why semicolons are optional in JavaScript
- Not available for debugging relationship issues (I'm still working on that feature)
```

**P.S.** - If my code doesn't work, I blame the compiler. If it works, I take full credit! 😎
